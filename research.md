I have worked on a variety of of different areas of research. Below is a description of my primary projects in each of these areas:
[deepfake detection](#deepfake-detection), 
[machine learning for computational biology](#machine-learning-for-computational-biology),
[chronic pain](#chronic-pain),
and [molecular immunology](#molecular-immunology).

## Deepfake Detection
*Research conducted at TrueMedia.org with Dr. Oren Etzioni.*

#### Benchmarking & creation of a real-world deepfake dataset

#### Harnessing 

#### LLM semantic analysis for audio deepfake detection 

####

## Machine Learning for Computational Biology
*Research conducted with Dr. Sara Mostafavi at the University of Washington Allen School of Computer Science.*
#### Discovering immune cell regulatory code through development of a new SOTA model of chromatin accessibility

## Chronic Pain
*Research conducted with Dr. Jennifer Rabbitts at Seattle Children's Hospital.*

#### Predicting post-surgical chronic pain outcomes in children

#### A systematic review & meta-analysis of post-traumatic chronic pain

## Molecular Immunology
*Research conducted with Dr. Naeha Subramanian at the Institute for Systems Biology*
