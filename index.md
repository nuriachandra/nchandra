Hi! My name is Nuria Alina Chandra. Folks who know me call me Alina. I am a machine learning researcher at TrueMedia.org. I am interested in peering into black-boxes (a.k.a. researching how & why machine learning models work), with an eye towards AI safety & AI for science. I've worked in a
[variety of different research areas](/research/) from wet-lab biology to [AI-generated content detection.](/research/#deepfake-detection)

When I'm not glued to my laptop, you can find me running around NYC, writing things, doing improv, and trying to capture light.
