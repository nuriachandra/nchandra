Hi! My name is Nuria Alina Chandra. Folks who know me call me Alina. I am a machine learning researcher at TrueMedia.org. I am interested in peering into black-boxes (a.k.a. researching how & why machine learning models work), with an eye towards AI safety & AI for science. I've worked in a
[variety of different research areas](/research/), most recently [AI-generated content detection](/research/#deepfake-detection) and [machine learning for computational biology.](/research/#machine-learning-for-computational-biology)

When I'm not glued to my laptop, you can find me running around NYC, [writing things](https://www.dailyuw.com/search/?tncms_csrf_token=8dc8389f450122551dfcf2a52ecb9d10fb4d32ed5abc808e9c2002a89cf6c092.6e476b62ee070bffca1f&l=25&s=start_time&sd=desc&nc%5B%5D=ask_the_experts&f=html&t=&app=editorial&nsa=eedition&q=Nuria+Chandra), and learning how to [juggle in Bryant Park](https://bryantpark.org/calendar/event/juggling-saturday).
