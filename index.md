Hi! My name is Nuria Alina Chandra. Folks who know me call me Alina. I am a machine learning researcher at TrueMedia.org. I am interested in peering into black-boxes (a.k.a. researching how & why machine learning models work), with an eye towards AI safety & AI for science. I've worked in a
[variety of different research areas](/research/), most recently [AI-generated content detection](/research/#deepfake-detection) and [machine learning for computational biology.](/research/#machine-learning-for-computational-biology)

When I'm not glued to my laptop, you can find me running around NYC, writing things, learning how to juggle at Bryant Park, and trying to capture light ðŸ“·.
